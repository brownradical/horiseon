## General info
Accesibility is key in making our world, especially our vitrual world, a better place. Thank you for your commitment in wanting to make your website more accesible and sustainable for growth as your business grows. In this revamp I have completed the following to increase accesibility for both the user and developer: reviewed and adjusted source code and structure; added alt text to site images; reviewed and adjusted proper heading and text sequence; etc.
